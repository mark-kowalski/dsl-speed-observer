# dsl-speed-observer
Tool to observe/track your dsl speed. The goal of this tool is to trigger a dsl speedtest at a specified time to observe the speed. Keep track of what you really get from your dsl provider.

Uses [showwin/speedtest-go](https://github.com/showwin/speedtest-go) to execute the speedtest. Eventually better to use [speedtest.net cli](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) directly.

# Existing Solutions
There are already high sophisticated solutions available that can already fulfill the use case I want to tackle here.
